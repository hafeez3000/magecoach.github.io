# Mage.coach Beta is open for testing!

We are very happy after months working on Mage.coach we are finally ready for a public beta. Mage.coach is a brand new **Magento Performance** reporting tool for both developers and merchants. What we do is pretty straighforward. Submit your url and select the option and wait. In the background we start a Docker based server incl the latest Chrome or Firefox browser which will start measuring how the website page renders on the frontend (simulated). We use a set of rules (coach) based on YSlow and PageSpeed definition.

Mage.coach is build to help you how to optimize Magento on the frontend, both UX, UI, SEO and Performance. New coach rules will be updated on a regular bases.
